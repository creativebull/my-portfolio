            Hello there, my name is Mehdi Ben Hadj Ali and i love doing stuff
            for internet espacially open-source projects. My love for the
            development started when i was 14: i was playing a french video game
            called Dofus and i wanted to automate repetitive things so i built a
            bot for the game (it's not fair i know üôÅ).
